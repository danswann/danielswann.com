# Hey there!
<br />
I'm Daniel, a software developer and lifelong computer nerd.
I was born and raised in central Florida and I received a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of Central Florida.
<br />
From ActionScript Flash games for the 2000s Internet to modern full-stack web apps hosted in the cloud, I've been programming for over 15 years!

My main passions are DevOps and Machine Learning, and I love working in TypeScript, Python, and C#.
<br />
When I'm not working, you will probably catch me playing video games, reading sci-fi, or hanging out with my dog Luna.
