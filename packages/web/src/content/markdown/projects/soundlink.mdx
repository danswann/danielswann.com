# Soundlink
<br />
Soundlink was a social media platform that emphasized playlist sharing via its mobile app. Users could post new playlists via Spotify integration, and were also presented a timeline of posts made by other users that they followed. It featured common social media interactions including likes, comments, reposts, a notification system, and real-time messages via WebSockets.

Soundlink was created as a group project in my junior year of college. The mobile app was made with React Native, the desktop site with standard React, and the backend with Express.js. It used to be hosted on Heroku and available as an APK, but is no longer maintained or operational.
